				<br>
				<h3>Living in Manhattan</h3>
				<p>Manhattan is one of the business capitals of the world. Whether you are in the world of finance, fashion, art, law or tech industry, your company can benefit from the hassle-free simplicity of renting one of our luxury units at a cost-effective price for your employees that are in Manhattan whether for a short term stay or a few months. Finding a place that is clean, in a good neighborhood and furnishing it can be a very time consuming and unnecessary process. Equally as hard is finding the proper supplier of high quality furnished short term rentals in New York City. Often, listings are not accurately described, stocked with poor quality supplies or furniture, and even the apartment itself may look vastly different from embellished pictures. This is sad but true. We know this from our own experience of having rented furnished apartments in Manhattan.</p>
				<p>Look no further, you have come to the right place for a quality stay. We take the headache right of out of the process. You can move New York City and know you will have peace of mind while at the same time getting a great deal for a beautifully curated apartment.</p>
				<h3>Cost effective</h3>
				<p>The savings of renting one of our apartments is greater than 50% or more than the cost of a hotel. Add a fully equiped kitchen and the benefit of cost savings is even greater through the ability to cook and eat from home. In addition, you are not cramped in a smaller space that is provided in a hotel.</p>
				<h3>Here are some of the things our units offer:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Luxurious units in luxurious buildings</li>
					<li>High security often requiring FOB access to the property</li>
					<li>Work ready spaces</li>
					<li>Smart TV, high speed Wi-Fi</li>
					<li>2nd Monitor with HDMI cable</li>
					<li>Fully stocked kitchen</li>
					<li>High quality and stylish furnishings</li>
					<li>In-unit W/D</li>

				</ul>
