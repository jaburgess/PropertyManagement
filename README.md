# Portfolio Project: Property Management Website

## Introduction
During my Database Systems class at the University of Iowa, a classmate and I were tasked with creating a hotel management system. This involved designing a simple database and implementing a basic front-end interface where users could check reservation availability and book rooms. It was crucial to ensure that both the database and user interface remained synchronized.

## Project Expansion
Driven by my interest in the project, I sought to expand upon it and create a more sophisticated version. Drawing inspiration from my parents, who were residing in a long-term rental at the time, I conceptualized a property management website catering to both long-term and short-term rentals. These properties would offer fully-furnished accommodations with various amenities and appliances.

## Development and Features
My vision for the website included a range of fictitious apartments, locations, amenities, and pricing options, all managed by fictional users. To bring this concept to life, I developed a functional full-stack application with detailed property descriptions, an intuitive user interface, and a robust database infrastructure. I used **MySQL** for the database management, **PHP** through the **Laravel** framework for the backend, and a combination of **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend development, complemented by the templating engine **Blade** for server side rendering within the Laravel framework. Key features of the application included user authentication and registration functionalities, allowing users to create accounts and log in. Once logged in, users could browse the website to discover unique properties tailored to their preferences. Properties were differentiated by amenities, specifications (such as number of bedrooms and square footage), available services, and booking dates. Users could select their desired dates and guest count to make reservations. While the application supported reservation management, user profiles, and an admin dashboard, it did not include a payment system, as it was intended as a mock site. The admin dashboard provided additional features such as property management statistics, reservation tracking, user management, and review management.

## Database Schema
Below is the basic schema for the database that I came up with. This link should take you to a website with an entity relationship diagram. This dragram shows what kind of information is stored and how things within the database relate.<br>

## Skill Development
Developing this full-stack application provided me with extensive experience in database design, data management, and user interface development. I thoroughly enjoyed crafting an effective database schema and refining the application's functionalities.

## Future Plans
Although the project is not hosted publicly due to costs of domain and hosting services, I plan to share a demonstration video on YouTube soon. Additionally, I will include an entity-relationship diagram of the rental database schema for reference.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies my ability to design, update, and maintain databases while also demonstrating my capability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions with real-world applications.
